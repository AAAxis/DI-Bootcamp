classical machine learning
modern machine learning

steps to use machine learning and prediction:

analysis = vizualitation 
preprocess
'y' is the letter used as symbol for the data that we want to predict

kinds of y can be = categorical(with classes) data and numerical(continuos) data

onde_hot_enconding = df.get_dummies(y)

define X = the data for trainning
 trainning fase = we pass real data to train the model to predict.
 each time that it trays another shot it gets more intelligent and the error rate is slower

 testing fase
